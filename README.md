A generative AI-powered tool that automates data cleaning tasks by dynamically generating and executing Python code based on natural language input.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project leverages Google's Gemini API to create a data cleaning automation tool that simplifies the process of preparing and cleaning datasets. Users can describe their data cleaning requirements in natural language, and the tool automatically generates and executes the corresponding Python code. The tool is designed to streamline data processing tasks, reduce manual effort, and improve the efficiency and accuracy of data pipelines.

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Users can describe data cleaning tasks in plain English.
- **Automated Code Generation**: The tool dynamically generates Python code based on user input.
- **Streamlit Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface for uploading CSV files, describing tasks, and viewing results.
- **Integration with Gemini API**: Utilizes Google's LLM to interpret user input and generate accurate code.
- **Data Cleaning Automation**: Reduces manual effort and improves efficiency in data pipelines.

## ðŸ§  Technical Implementation

### Files
- `sentient.py` - Main script for the data cleaning automation tool.
- `requirements.txt` - List of dependencies for the project.
- `example_data.csv` - Sample dataset for testing the tool.

### Data Flow
1. **User Input**: The user uploads a CSV file and describes the data cleaning task in natural language.
2. **Code Generation**: The Gemini API interprets the user's input and generates the corresponding Python code.
3. **Code Execution**: The generated code is executed on the uploaded dataset.
4. **Result Display**: The cleaned dataset is displayed to the user via the Streamlit interface.
